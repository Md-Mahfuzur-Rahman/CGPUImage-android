GPUImage implements by c++, the android example


# Something not complete
1.GPUImageMaskFilter has some thing not implements


2.GPUImageMosaicFilter the square.png deocode has a question,
the picture has transport, decoding the picture the transport data will
be 0xffffff, the effect is not correct


3.GPUImageSphereRefractionFilter the effect is incorrect, and I don't know why.


4.GPUImagePoissonBlendFilter is not test and the m_uNumIterations is not implement
